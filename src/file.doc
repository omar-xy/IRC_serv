Invite-Only Channel Mode
This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is "+i".
This channel mode controls whether new users need to be invited to the channel before being able to join.
If this mode is set on a channel, a user must have received an INVITE for this channel before being allowed to join it. 
If they have not received an invite, they will receive an ERR_INVITEONLYCHAN (473) reply and the command will fail.
ERR_INVITEONLYCHAN //  "<client> <channel> :Cannot join channel (+i)"

Key Channel Mode
This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is "+k".
This mode letter sets a ‘key’ that must be supplied in order to join this channel. If this mode is set, its’ value is the key that is required. Servers may validate the value (eg. to forbid spaces, as they make it harder to use the key in JOIN messages). 
If the value is invalid, they SHOULD return ERR_INVALIDMODEPARAM. However, clients MUST be able to handle any of the following:

ERR_INVALIDMODEPARAM
ERR_INVALIDKEY // "<client> <target chan> :Key is not well-formed"
MODE echoed with a different key (eg. truncated or stripped of invalid characters)
the key changed ignored, and no MODE echoed if no other mode change was valid.
If this mode is set on a channel, and a client sends a JOIN request for that channel, 
they must supply <key> in order for the command to succeed. If they do not supply a <key>, 
or the key they supply does not match the value of this mode, 
they will receive an ERR_BADCHANNELKEY (475) reply and the command will fail.


Protected Topic Mode
This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is "+t".
This channel mode controls whether channel privileges are required to set the topic, and does not have any value.
If this mode is enabled, users must have channel privileges such as halfop or operator 
status in order to change the topic of a channel. In a channel that does not have this mode enabled,
anyone may set the topic of the channel using the TOPIC command.
